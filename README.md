This project predicts whether a patient has **diabetes** or not using **Machine Learning classification models**.  

It focuses on **binary classification** (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic) and implements:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature scaling  
- Handling imbalanced data (if necessary)  
- Model training using classification algorithms  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
- Real-time prediction interface using **Streamlit** or Flask
